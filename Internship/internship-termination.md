Dear [Intern's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

Despite repeated reminders and requests for active participation and communication with your mentors, we have noticed continued inactivity on your part. As per our strict internship policy, active engagement and timely responses are essential for the successful completion of the program.

Regrettably, due to your sustained inactivity, we must terminate your internship with immediate effect.

However, if you are still interested in growing your skills and learning, we encourage you to contact us through WhatsApp at +91 9579809745. Further steps and learning materials will be discussed with you, allowing you to work on your own and continue your development.

We wish you the best in your future endeavors and hope to see you take proactive steps towards your professional growth.
