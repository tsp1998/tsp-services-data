## Development Policy
### Last Updated: 20/06/2024

1. **Fees Involved**

    - **Development Fee**: The development fee for each project or service is stated on the solutions page. This fee covers the cost of our services and projects.

    - **Hosting Fee**: The hosting fee varies based on the hosting service you choose from the hosting providers.


2. **Hosting Timeline**

    - The hosting timeline is determined by the specific service you select from the hosting provider.


3. **Project Scope Updates and Changes**
    - Additional fees may apply for any subsequent updates or changes to the project or service scope or requirements.
    - You will be informed in advance about the impact on the development fee.
    - The fee will range from 10% to 99% of the original development fee, depending on the extent of the changes within the same solution.
    - If updates require the purchase of new services/products or the extension of existing ones, the associated fees will be communicated to you. Detailed information about the cost and requirements of the updates will be provided, enabling you to make an informed decision. Please note that these fees are separate from the initial development and hosting fees.


4. **Significant Requirement Changes**
    - If you have significant changes to your requirements after the initial purchase, you will need to select a different solution to accommodate those changes.


5. **Third-Party Services and Licenses**
    - Any third-party services or licenses required for development, such as APIs or software, may be billed separately and are not included in the development fee. If you have already purchased these services, you can provide us with access for integration, or you may choose to perform the integration yourself if desired.


6. **Independent Hosting Solution Purchase**
    - When purchasing a hosting solution independently, it is important to use the provided links to ensure access to all available solutions.


7. **Third-Party Service Integration**
    - Integration with third-party services may require additional time to ensure the full functionality of associated features. The timeline for integration and the responsiveness of third-party providers can impact the overall development process. While we strive for smooth integration, delays caused by third-party factors are beyond our control.


8. **Custom Solutions**
    - If your project requirements do not align with the listed solutions or if you have unique needs, please reach out to us directly. We offer customized solutions tailored to your specific requirements. Our team will work closely with you to understand your needs and provide a personalized quote and development plan.
