## Terms & Conditions
### Last Updated: 21/06/2024

1. **Accounts Management**:
    - All accounts related to hosting, third-party services, and other necessary services for your project will be exclusively managed by our team at TSPSoft Tech.
    - If you require access to one or more of your accounts, please request access at the beginning of the project purchase process.

    - **Requesting Access**:
        - We strongly advise requesting access to accounts only if you possess the necessary technical expertise and relevant skills to manage them effectively.
    
    - **Responsibility Upon Access**:
        - Once access to the accounts is granted, the full responsibility for those accounts and their ongoing maintenance will be transferred to you.


2. **Security Measures**:
    - To ensure the highest level of security for your accounts, access will only be granted if requested at the time of project and services purchase. This precaution minimizes potential security risks, such as:

        - **Source Code Breach**: Unauthorized access to the software's source code can be prevented by granting access only to authorized individuals.
        
        - **Tampering with Source Code and Data**: Limiting accounts access reduces the risk of unauthorized tampering with your software's source code, data, security settings, and configurations.
        
        - **Protection Against Attackers**: Granting accounts access exclusively to individuals who follow best security practices and possess adequate security knowledge helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access by attackers.
        
        - **Safeguarding Credibility**: By prioritizing security measures and adhering to best practices, we uphold our commitment to maintaining a high level of credibility in providing secure services.
        
        - **Hosting Accounts Access**: Specifically for hosting accounts, we highly recommend customers request access only if they are confident in their technical expertise. Additionally, customers should not share the source code of our software that powers their project.


3. **Post-Purchase Accounts Access**:
    - If you require accounts access after the initial purchase, you can purchase project newly again and submit an accounts access request during this new purchase process.
    - Our team will ensure that no security issues arise from our side when granting access.
    - However, please note that once access is granted, you will be solely responsible for any issues that may occur thereafter.


4. **Changing Accounts Credentials**:
    - To maintain the highest level of security, we highly recommend changing the accounts credentials once you have been granted access.
    - This is an important step in following best security practices and helps ensure the integrity and protection of your accounts.


5. **Source Code and Intellectual Property**:
    - Please note that you will receive the code specific to your project, but not the source code of the software that powers it.
    - The software source code is considered intellectual property and will not be provided.
    - However, if you require the binary version of the software, you can submit a request, and our team will assist you accordingly.


6. **Content Responsibility**:
    - The content required for the project must be provided by the customer, who holds the responsibility for ensuring that the content does not infringe any intellectual property rights.
    - While our team can offer assistance and guidance on obtaining free or paid content sources, the customer is ultimately responsible for providing the content for their project.


7. **Services & Support Suspension**:
    - We reserve the right to suspend or terminate services and support offered to you  if we suspect any violation of our terms and conditions, misuse of resources, or fraudulent activity.


8. **Third-Party Services**:
    - If your project requires integration with third-party services, we cannot guarantee their availability, performance, or continued support.
    - Any issues arising from these services will be subject to their respective terms and conditions and policies.


9. **Privacy and Data Security**:
    - We are committed to safeguarding your data and take appropriate measures to protect it.
    - However, please be aware that no system is completely immune to risks, and we recommend implementing your own security measures and adhering to data protection regulations if you are maintaining the accounts.

    - **Additional Fees**: In certain cases, development may be hindered due to additional fees related to hosting or third-party services/products. We will promptly communicate these fees to you, and it is essential to settle them as early as possible to prevent any delays in the development process.

    - **Refund Period**: The refund period will be calculated from the day when 100% of the fee is paid for all aspects mentioned above, including hosting and third-party services/products, if applicable. These hosting/services/products, as applicable, will be purchased on the same day of full fee submission.
